Certain areas of the park have proven to be better for finding different species of birds. 

Trout Lake itself usually has a large number of Mallard and wigeon, with a few other species of ducks, plus American Coots and Pied-billed Grebes from October through April. During the same time period many gulls use the lake for bathing and drinking first thing in the morning. This park has proven notable for being one of the most reliable locations for finding California and Western Gulls during this period. 

Anna's Hummingbirds are frequently seen on the tops of small trees surrounding the lake.
